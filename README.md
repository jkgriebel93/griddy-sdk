## Quick Start

### NFL.com Data

```python
from griddy import nfl

# Initialize client
client = nfl.Client()

# Get games for current week
games = client.get_games(season=2024, week=1)
for game in games:
    print(f"{game.away_team} @ {game.home_team}: {game.status}")

# Get team information
teams = client.get_teams()
for team in teams[:5]:
    print(f"{team.name} ({team.abbreviation})")

# Get player statistics
stats = client.get_player_stats("player_id", season=2024, week=1)
for stat in stats:
    print(f"Week {stat.week}: {stat.passing_yards} passing yards")
```

### Pro Football Reference Data

```python
from griddy import pfr

# Initialize client
client = pfr.Client()

# Search for players
players = client.search_players("Brady", position="QB")
for player in players:
    print(f"{player.name} - {player.position}")

# Get career statistics
career_stats = client.get_player_career_stats("player_id")
if career_stats:
    print(f"Career passing yards: {career_stats.career_totals.pass_yards}")

# Get draft information
draft_picks = client.get_draft_class(2023)
first_round = [p for p in draft_picks if p.round == 1]
for pick in first_round[:5]:
    print(f"{pick.pick}. {pick.player_name} - {pick.team}")
```

### ESPN Data

```python
from griddy import espn

# Initialize client
client = espn.Client()

# Get current scoreboard
scoreboard = client.get_scoreboard()
print(f"Games on {scoreboard.date}: {len(scoreboard.games)}")

# Get live scores
live_games = client.get_live_scores()
for game in live_games:
    print(f"{game.away_team} {game.away_score} - {game.home_score} {game.home_team}")

# Get team roster
roster = client.get_team_roster("team_id")
quarterbacks = [p for p in roster if p.position == "QB"]
for qb in quarterbacks:
    print(f"#{qb.jersey_number} {qb.name}")

# Get news
news = client.get_news(limit=5)
for article in news:
    print(f"{article.headline} - {article.published}")
```

### Pro Football Focus Data

```python
from griddy import pff

# Initialize client (with optional API key)
client = pff.Client(api_key="your_pff_api_key")

# Get player grades
grades = client.get_player_grades("player_id", season=2024, week=1)
print(f"Overall Grade: {grades.overall_grade}")
print(f"Pass Rush Grade: {grades.defense.pass_rush_grade}")

# Get position rankings
qb_rankings = client.get_position_rankings("QB", season=2024, limit=10)
for i, qb in enumerate(qb_rankings, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {qb.player_id}: {qb.overall_grade}")

# Get team grades
team_grades = client.get_team_grades("KC", season=2024)
print(f"Offense: {team_grades.overall_offense_grade}")
print(f"Defense: {team_grades.overall_defense_grade}")

# Get draft prospects
prospects = client.get_draft_board(2024, limit=10)
for prospect in prospects:
    print(f"{prospect.name} - {prospect.position} ({prospect.pff_grade})")
```

## Configuration

### Rate Limiting

All clients support rate limiting configuration:

```python
from griddy import nfl

client = nfl.Client(
    rate_limit_delay=2.0,  # 2 second delay between requests
    max_retries=5,         # Retry failed requests up to 5 times
    timeout=60             # 60 second request timeout
)
```

### Custom Headers

Add custom headers to requests:

```python
from griddy import espn

client = espn.Client(
    headers={
        "Custom-Header": "custom-value",
        "User-Agent": "My App/1.0"
    }
)
```

## Error Handling

The SDK provides comprehensive error handling:

```python
from griddy import nfl
from griddy.core.exceptions import GriddyError, RateLimitError, NotFoundError

client = nfl.Client()

try:
    games = client.get_games(season=2024, week=1)
except RateLimitError as e:
    print(f"Rate limited. Retry after: {e.retry_after} seconds")
except NotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Resource not found: {e.message}")
except GriddyError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e.message} (Status: {e.status_code})")
```

## Data Models

All data is returned as typed Pydantic models:

```python
from griddy.nfl.models import NFLGame

# Games have structured data
game: NFLGame = client.get_games(season=2024, week=1)[0]

# Access with full type safety
print(game.home_team)      # str
print(game.home_score)     # Optional[int]
print(game.start_time)     # Optional[datetime]
print(game.status)         # str
```

- Rate limiting recommended for respectful usage
- Data availability may vary

### Pro Football Reference
- No official API - requires web scraping
- Respectful rate limiting is essential
- Historical data coverage is extensive

### ESPN
- Public API available for some endpoints
- Rate limits apply
- Live data may require special access

### Pro Football Focus
- Premium subscription-based API
- API key required for authenticated requests
- Advanced analytics and proprietary grades
